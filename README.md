# hello-world

Mountains for my mansion
The forest for my pantry
The clouds for my carpet
The sky for my curtains
The sun for my candle
The wind for my chariot
In the company of eagles

Flying above fear
Floating above failures
Winging above worries
Gliding above gravity
Living above limits
Soaring to success
Come fly with me
